# SQL_movie_rental_analysis
Using SQL to analyze a movie rental database for data driven answers to business questions

The management board of the fictional company Rockbuster Stealth is looking to have an analyst use SQl to answer the following questions.

Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

What was the average rental duration for all videos?

Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
